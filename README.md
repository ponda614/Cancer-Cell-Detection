## Project Overview
In this project, I want to develop a deep learning model that can recognize Tunneling Nanotubes (TNTs) in images of cancer cells. TNTs are essential to the way cancer cells behave and communicate. My goal is to make a contribution to the larger field of cancer diagnosis and analysis by automating the identification of TNTs in fluorescence images of cell cultures. This endeavor is merely a small step toward a more comprehensive comprehension and identification of the intricacies of cancer through sophisticated image analysis.

## Libraries
The project utilizes the following libraries:

| Library                | Description                                                  |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| TensorFlow Keras       | A powerhouse for building and training deep learning models, making complex neural network tasks more manageable. |
| NumPy                  | Essential for numerical computing, it's the backbone for heavy-duty data manipulation, especially with image arrays. |
| Pandas                 | Data manipulation and analysis library for working with structured data. |
| OpenCV                 | The go-to for image processing, helping us transform and understand visual information from our data. |
| Matplotlib             | Plotting library for creating various types of visualizations. |
| Seaborn                | Enhances Matplotlib's capabilities, offering a more refined and visually appealing take on data visualization. |
| scikit-learn           | Machine learning library for data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation. |
| ImageDataGenerator     | Part of TensorFlow Keras, it's great for expanding our dataset through real-time image augmentation, ensuring robust model training. |

## Methodology
- **Preprocessing**: Utilizing a sliding window technique to extract smaller patches from large fluorescence images of cancer cells.
- **Labeling**: Labeling image patches containing TNTs for training the classifier.
- **Model Development**: Using a VGG16-based model with transfer learning and custom additional layers.
- **Training**: Employing data augmentation, early stopping, and checkpoints during model training.

## Results

Our model training showed signs of overfitting, which led to the activation of the early stopping mechanism before completing all 50 epochs. Here are the details from the last two epochs before early stopping was triggered:

- **Epoch 37**
  - Training Accuracy: 89.92%
  - Validation Accuracy: 67.48%

- **Epoch 38 (Final Epoch)**
  - Training Accuracy: 91.98%
  - Validation Accuracy: 66.67%


## Conclusion
The model demonstrated high accuracy on the training data, indicating effective learning. However, the lower accuracy on the validation set, coupled with the trend of decreasing validation accuracy, suggests overfitting. Our early stopping callback, a measure to prevent overfitting, halted the training at epoch 38.

I am still currently working on addressing this overfitting issue. Strategies being explored include adjusting the network architecture, applying more robust regularization techniques, and experimenting with different data augmentation methods. My goal is to enhance the model's ability to generalize new, unseen data, ensuring it performs well not just on the training set but also on the validation set

**Learning from Data**: Our model showed a strong ability to learn from training data, achieving an accuracy of about 90% in its final epochs.
  
**The Role of Early Stopping**: Implementing early stopping was a key step. It helped us prevent the model from learning the noise in our training data, ensuring that we maintain a focus on true patterns.

**Next Steps**: Still exploring ways to improve the model. This includes tweaking the architecture, exploring new regularization techniques, and diversifying our training data. 

**The Bigger Picture**: Despite these challenges, I am excited about the potential impact of our work. Improving the model's ability to detect TNTs could have significant implications in cancer research.
